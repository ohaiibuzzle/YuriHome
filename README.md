# Yuri Home

(Aka the code Buzzle uses to get cute photos)

The script is in **TypeScript** so... 
`ts-node app.ts`

There are a few changes you can make to your liking in `app.ts`. I could made config files for this but I'm too lazy:tm:

By the way, there is a live demo [here!](https://yurihome.herokuapp.com)
